    - Use variables for colors (variables are in navbar.css, see navbar.css for examples too)
    - Put html in the html folder and css in the css folder
    - Use comments on your work (don't just explain what a line of code does, explain why you did it that way)
    - Try to avoid solutions using transform: translate, it can break the hamburger menu
